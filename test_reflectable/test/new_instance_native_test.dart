// Based on https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/18541; ported to fit in
// reflectable: Changed symbols to strings; added reflector and quantifier;
// removed usages of `reflectee` to bypass the mirror (that reflectable
// already avoids creating). Uses type annotations like all other parts of
// reflectable. This variant was again created as a variant of
// 'new_instance_html_test.dart' which does not depend on 'dart:html'.
