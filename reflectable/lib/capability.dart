library reflectable.capability;

// The class [ReflectCapability] and its subclasses form a domain
// specific language (DSL) in that they can be used to create tree
// structures that correspond to abstract syntax trees for expressions.
// The semantics of those expressions is to enable a certain subset of
// the operations on mirrors that are available according to the APIs in
// mirrors.dart.  The constraints specify both which members of
// instances of a given mirror class are available, and which arguments
// they can receive.  An exception is thrown if a method is invoked
// which is not supported according to the given constraints, and if an
// available method is called with arguments that do not satisfy the
// constraints.  The point is that the constraints define a subset of
// the apparent functionality of mirrors.dart, and the amount of code
// generated for such a subset will be much smaller than the amount of
// code generated for the unconstrained case.
//
// NB! It is crucial that all changes made in this library are
// performed in the corresponding manner in `src/element_capability.dart`,
// and vice versa.
