// This file defines the same types as sdk/lib/mirrors/mirrors.dart, in
// order to enable code using [dart:mirrors] to switch to using
// [Reflectable] based mirrors with the smallest possible change.
// The changes are discussed below, under headings on the form
// 'API Change: ..'.

// API Change: Incompleteness.
//
// Compared to the corresponding classes in [dart:mirrors], a number of
// classes have been omitted and some methods have been omitted from some
// classes, based on the needs arising in concrete examples.  Additional
// methods may be added later if the need arises and if they can be
// implemented.  These missing elements are indicated by comments on the
// form '// Currently skip ..' in the code below.

// API Change: Returning non-mirrors.
//
// One kind of difference exists:  We took the opportunity to change the
// returned values of reflective operations from mirrors to base values.
// E.g., [invoke] in [ObjectMirror] has return type [Object] rather than
// [InstanceMirror].  If myObjectMirror is [ObjectMirror] then evaluation
// of, e.g., myObjectMirror.invoke(..) yields the same result as that of
// myObjectMirror.invoke(..).reflectee in [dart:mirrors].  The point is
// that returning base values may be cheaper in typical scenarios (no
// mirror objects created, and they were never used anyway) and there is
// no loss of information (we can get a mirror on the returned value).
// So we move from the "pure" design where the reflective level is
// always preserved to a "practical" model where we return to the base
// level in selected cases.
//
// These selected cases are [invoke], [getField], and
// [setField] in [ObjectMirror], [newInstance] in
// [ClassMirror], and [defaultValue] in [ParameterMirror], where the
// return type has been changed from InstanceMirror to Object.
// Similarly, the return type for [metadata] in [DeclarationMirror] and
// in [LibraryDependencyMirror] was changed from List<InstanceMirror> to
// List<Object>.  The relevant locations in the code below have been
// marked with comments on the form '// RET: <old-return-type>'
// resp. '// TYARG: <old-type-argument>' and the discrepancies are
// mentioned in the relevant class dartdoc.
//
// TODO(eernst) doc: The information given in the previous paragraph
// should be made part of the dartdoc comments on each of the relevant
// methods; since those comments will now differ from the ones in
// dart:mirrors, we should copy them all and add the discrepancies.
//
// A similar change could have been applied to many other methods, but
// in those cases it seems more likely that the mirror will be used
// in its own right rather than just to get 'theMirror.reflectee'.
// Some of these locations are marked with '// Possible'.  They are in
// general concerned with types in a broad sense: [ClassMirror],
// [TypeMirror], and [LibraryMirror].

// TODO(eernst) doc: The preceeding comment blocks should be made a dartdoc
// on the library when/if such dartdoc comments are supported.
// TODO(eernst) doc: Change the preceeding comment to use a more
// user-centric style.

// TODO(eernst) doc: This is a Meta-TODO, adding detail to several TODOs below
// saying 'make this .. more user friendly' as well as the comment above
// saying 'more user-centric'. All those "not-so-friendly" comments originate
// in the `mirrors.dart` file that implements the `dart:mirrors` library, so
// missing dartdoc comments in this file would typically be taken from
// there and then adjusted to match the preferred style in this library.
// The following points should be kept in mind in this adjustment process:
//   1. The documentation from `dart:mirrors` is too abstract for typical
// programmers (it is in a near-spec style), so maybe that kind of
// documentation should be provided in a separate location, and the
// documentation that programmers get to see first will be example based
// and less abstract.
//   2. Formatting: *name* is used to indicate pseudo-semantic entities
// such as objects (that may or may not be the value of a known expression)
// and meta-variables for identifiers, etc. This is explained in the
// documentation for `dart:mirrors` (search 'Dart pseudo-code' on
// https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/dartdoc-viewer/dart:mirrors)
//   3. Semantic precision may be pointless in cases where the underlying
// concepts are obvious; having an example based frontmost layer and a more
// spec-styled layer behind it would be helpful with this as well, because
// the example layer could be quite simple.
//   4. Considering `invokeGetter`, the example based approach could be
// similar to the following:
//
//   Invokes a getter and returns the result. Conceptually, this function is
//   equivalent to `this.reflectee.name` where the `name` identifier is the
//   value of the given [getterName].
//
//   Example:
//     var m = reflectable.reflect(o);
//     m.invokeGetter("foo");  // Equivalent to o.foo.
//
//   (then give more detail if the simple explanation above needs it).

   * of the [String].

   * could also consider extending the interface with a
