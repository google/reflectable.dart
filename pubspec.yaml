name: reflectable
version: 2.0.1
description: >
  This package allows programmers to reduce certain usages of dynamic
  reflection to a statically specified subset thereof, based on generated
  code with the same behavior as mirrors provided by 'dart:mirrors'. The
  generated code does not use dynamic reflection and thus improves the
  resource economy (esp. by using a smaller amount of space than dart2js
  generated code).
